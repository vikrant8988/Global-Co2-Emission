# Global CO2 Emissions Analysis Using Tableau

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of global CO2 emissions using Tableau. The project focuses on profiling and QA of the data, visualizing global emission trends, and building an interactive dashboard for an in-depth exploration of the findings.

## Project Objectives

1. **Profile & QA the Data:**
   - Collect and clean the global CO2 emissions dataset.
   - Perform data quality checks to ensure accuracy and consistency.
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and anomalies in the dataset.

2. **Visualize the Data:**
   - Create visualizations to explore global CO2 emission trends over time.
   - Break down emissions by country and region.
   - Highlight patterns of industrial impact on global CO2 levels.

3. **Build an Interactive Dashboard:**
   - Develop a user-friendly Tableau dashboard to allow interactive exploration of the data.
   - Incorporate filters for countries, regions, and emission types to enable dynamic analysis.
   - Make key insights accessible through visuals, trends, and summaries.

## Dataset

The data used in this project is a historical dataset of global CO2 emissions by country, covering multiple decades. It includes details on emissions from fossil fuel combustion, industry, and land-use changes.
Global fossil fuel emission data from 1750 to 2021.

## Key Insights

- The analysis reveals that the United States, despite having a smaller population, contributes significantly more CO2 emissions compared to highly populous countries like India and China.
- This disparity highlights the impact of industrial activities and lifestyle differences on carbon emissions, showing that a higher population does not necessarily equate to higher emissions per country.

## Future Enhancements

- Adding time series forecasts for emissions.
- Incorporating more granular data (e.g., per capita emissions).
- Expanding the dashboard to compare CO2 emissions with other environmental factors.
